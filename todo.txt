BUG - contextmenu occasionally rendering part offscreen

Implement weight affecting time it takes to do actions, uniformly across actions somehow
- maybe through a Player method on the server?

remove game_active variable for the client

update server client connection to better version from JumpShootOnline

Make spectators be able to walk around, see things/items, and do the search game,
just can't interact with anything (disable the contextmenu / only have one thing
in the contextmenu saying you're a spectator)
- CURRENTLY SPECTATOR IS VERY BROKEN - issue with name for spectator socket not being registered in id_to_name,
  error in server's "cannotFind" socket handler on line 230 b/c player not defined as a result

Ditch server tracked elements - we don't really need to see where everyone is,
and in reality you'd only know someone was somewhere if they were where you are
- ... unless knowing where everyone is promotes player interaction?
- note: planning to have PlayerDisplay as a Thing, so you know who else is where you are
- maybe you can poke them or send them a message or give them items

Figure out how to / if want to make climbing trees, diving, etc. lead you to a new place that
has the same adjacencies as the main place. Would somehow need to be generated by a Thing,
and do some weird stuff with the Map (since you wouldn't want a new vertex shown to the client)
- maybe Places can have Subplaces that aren't in the Map and don't change a player's location (sublocation?),
  but use the same / similar constructor as a Place?
- somehow specify to ignore the place when drawing the map graph
- Make it so you can't access the map until returning to the main place (send an alert to the player)
  - would make sense if in a tree that you have to climb down first
