BUG - weird thing where a twig didn't contract in search_div, likely something to do w/ Mommy picking it up
BUG - expanding animation in inventory some time after the taking action (I thought I got rid of this?)

Get rid of map, just have game.place_def and game.places

remove game_active variable for the client?

update server client connection to better version from JumpShootOnline

Make spectators be able to walk around, see things/items (including hidden ones)
just can't interact with anything (disable the contextmenu / only have one thing
in the contextmenu saying you're a spectator)
- CURRENTLY SPECTATOR IS VERY BROKEN - issue with name for spectator socket not being registered in id_to_name,
  error in server's "cannotFind" socket handler on line 230 b/c player not defined as a result

Ditch server tracked elements? - we don't really need to see where everyone is,
and in reality you'd only know someone was somewhere if they were where you are
- ... unless knowing where everyone is promotes player interaction?
- note: planning to have PlayerDisplay as a Thing, so you know who else is where you are
- maybe you can poke them or send them a message or give them items

Figure out how to / if want to make climbing trees, diving, etc. lead you to a new place that
has the same adjacencies as the main place. Would somehow need to be generated by a Thing,
and do some weird stuff with the Map (since you wouldn't want a new vertex shown to the client)
- maybe Places can have Subplaces that aren't in the Map and don't change a player's location (sublocation?),
  but use the same / similar constructor as a Place?
- somehow specify to ignore the place when drawing the map graph
- Make it so you can't access the map until returning to the main place (send an alert to the player)
  - would make sense if in a tree that you have to climb down first
