/*
"Things" are anything that can be placed at a location that is not an item. They cannot be picked up.
More things will be generated than are actually needed


Things are defined as classes, and must have the following member variables and methods:

    name: string
    items: array of item objects generated by this Thing
    visible: true/false, whether it is visible without searching
    getInteractions(Player): function returning an object {actions: [], messages: []} - arrays of strings
        - actions are stuff the player can do, messages are any information relating to the thing to show the player
        - for each possible action, there needs to be a method with the same name, taking a player state as an argument
        - (will convert action name to lowercase, and replace spaces with underscores to get method name, see server.js)

Sometimes not specified:

    found_by: array of player names, who found this thing. Only specified if not visible
    p: 0-1.0, probability of finding it in a general search. Only specified if not visible
    p_focus: 0-1.0, probability of finding it when focusing on it. Only specified if not visible
    leave(Player): Optional, function to run when the player leaves this place

Experiment with later:
exclusive: true/false, assumed false if not specified. If true, once a player starts interacting with this Thing, they can't interact with
            another Thing or leave until the method disengage(Player) is called. If the Place this Thing is in sees exclusive is true, it
            will define a disengage method, so no need to write that in the class definition
