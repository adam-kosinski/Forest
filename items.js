/*
"Items" are collected as part of the scavenger hunt
This is not to be confused with "things," which is everything else that can be placed at a location
Also, only items (not things) can be picked up by players

Only a subset of items will be used for each hunt, but many other unused items also be placed in the forest
Items are generated by places, or by things located in a place

Items are defined as classes, with lots of variations, all extending the main Item class
Each class is required to have the below member variables and methods

    name: string, assumed that items with the same name are the same (instead of making new items, will just increment quantity), unless have different tags
    img_src: string of image file name, from the directory ./static/images/items/
        - if omitted, no image will be rendered
    quantity: integer
    categories: array of categories (strings) this item belongs to. These may be used as item descriptions given to the players
              - this will not be an exhaustive list, but should include the less general/more objective categories
    weight: number, how heavy it is; how much it slows the player down
    visible: true/false, whether it is visible without searching
    copy(): returns a copy, basically just calling the constructor with the same arguments. Used by the main Item class for several things

Sometimes not specified:

    tags: array of strings, used to mark items with the same name as different. Optional.
    found_by: array of player names, who found this item. Only specified if not visible
    p: 0-1.0, probability of finding it in a general search. Only specified if not visible
    p_focus: 0-1.0, probability of finding it when focusing on it. Only specified if not visible
    canTake(Player): optional method, run to check if a player can take an item. Returns "yes" if they can, otherwise returns a string explaining why they can't
              - if not defined, assumed "yes"
              - arg is the player's player state object
    canFind(Player): optional method, run to check if a player can find this item. Returns "yes" if they can, something else if they can't
              - only specified if not visible
              - if not defined, assumed "yes"
